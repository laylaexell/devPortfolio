Mini Projects

Here I have got some coding work I have done. I developed a love for coding when I signed onto a Udemy course in 2024. I progressed with HTML and CSS, creating mini projects using Visual Studio Code. I have uploaded some of these in this repository. I slowed down on Udemy due to the masters course, therefore my JavaScript is very basic and I'm practising slowly with JavaScript but not created any projects with it yet. 

The Copa 71 project stems from my love for women's football. I researched into this tournement and thought why not create a project from this, so I did! Using Figma software, to prototype micro interactions and develop a mini creative toolkit.

The Copa 71 project is a basic mini project showcasing my HTML and CSS skills, experimenting with responsive design & multiple webpages.  

I would love to improve this project over time and slowly incorporate Javascript functions, with the help of React.
